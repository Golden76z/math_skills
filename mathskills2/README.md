
```go
This file has a purpose of applying different kinds of mathematical functions
to a file data.txt that contains a list of numbers separated by a line break.

"It will read the data.txt file, get all the data inside and test if they are 
numbers or not (it won't work with non numbers values)."

Average: "It's the addition of all values divided by the number of values."

Median: "It takes the middle value of data values that needs to be sorted
beforehand."

Variance: "It's the sum of all squared values.
We then divide that value obtained by the number of values in our data.txt.
And then we decreases that value by the squared value of the Average."

Standard Deviation: "It's the square root of the Variance value
obtained just before."
